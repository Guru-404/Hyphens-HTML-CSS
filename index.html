        The hyphens property controls hyphenation of text in block level
        elements. You can prevent hyphenation from happening at all, allow it,
        or only allow it when certain characters are present.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that hyphens is language-sensitive. Its ability to find break
        opportunities depends on the language, defined in the lang attribute of
        a parent element. Not all languages are supported yet, and support
        depends on the specific browser.
      </p>
      <h2>Syntax</h2>
      <p>.element { hyphens: none | manual | auto }</p>
      <h4>hyphens: none</h4>
      <p>
        Words are never hyphenated at line breaks, even if characters inside the
        word suggest where hyphenation could or should go.
      </p>
      <h4>hyphens: manual</h4>
      <p>
        Words are only broken at line breaks where there are characters inside
        the word that suggest line break opportunities. There are two characters
        that suggest line break opportunity:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          U+2010 (HYPHEN): the “hard” hyphen character indicates a visible line
          break opportunity. Even if the line is not actually broken at that
          point, the hyphen is still rendered. Literally a "-"".
        </li>
        <li>
          U+00AD (SHY): an invisible, "soft" hyphen. This character is not
          rendered visibly; instead, it suggests a place where the browser might
          choose to break the word if necessary. In HTML, you can use &shy to
          insert a soft hyphen.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>hyphens: auto</h4>
      <p>
        Words can be broken at appropriate hyphenation points either as
        determined by hyphenation characters (see above) inside the word or as
        determined automatically by a language-appropriate hyphenation resource
        (if supported by the browser or provided via @hyphenation-resource).
      </p>
      <p>
        Conditional hyphenation characters inside a word, if present, take
        priority over automatic resources when determining hyphenation points
        within the word.
      </p>
      <h4>hyphens: all</h4>
      <p>
        Deprecated, do not use. This was only in the spec temporarily for
        testing.
      </p>
      <h3>Browser support</h3>
      <p>
        Safari 5+ requires -webkit-, Firefox 6+ requires -moz-, IE 10+ requires
        -ms-, iOS 4.2+ requires -webkit-.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chrome less than 55 and Android browser actually support
        -webkit-hyphens: none, which is the default value, but none of the other
        values.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Firefox and Internet Explorer, automatic hyphenation only works for
        some languages (defined with the lang attribute). See
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=CSS%2Fhyphens#browser_compatibility"
          >this note</a
        >
        for a comprehensive list of supported languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are writing a web-based document that really need hyphenation,
        you can use <a href="https://github.com/mnater/hyphenator">Hyphenator.js</a> which is a library based on a vast dictionary
        that will automatically inject soft hyphens and zero-width spaces into
        your content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without JavaScript, you'll have to rely on both hyphens and word-wrap:
      </p>
      <p>
        .hyphenate {
        <br />
        word-wrap: break-word;
        <br />
        overflow-wrap: break-word;
        <br />
        -webkit-hyphens: auto;
        <br />
        -moz-hyphens: auto;
        <br />
        hyphens: auto;
        <br />
        }
      </p>
